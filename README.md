Bobby Has a Gun is my first project, an extremely simple one. It's meant to be that one project that you finish within a week, so it's not much. For this, I had to make all the assets and also learn basic C# for coding the player (Bobby), the enemy, and the UI and learn how to make basic UI elements on Unity. On the Player, I got a basic character controller script from a tutorial and made the character movement, weapon and bullet scrips following a tutorial as well.
